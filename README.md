# UX Designer II Take Home Assessment

This document outlines the UX Designer II take-home assessment for System Initiative. It is designed to verify:

* Your proficiency with high-fidelity prototyping and user flow creation.
* Your ability to conceptualize and design features that enhance collaboration.
* Your capacity to make thoughtful design decisions and clearly articulate their value.

We use a take-home assessment to allow you to work in your most productive environment. Feel free to use any tools, resources, or references that you need. We recommend spending no more than 4 hours on this assessment. While the scope of this exercise may exceed the time allotted, we aim to understand how you prioritize and break down complex problems into manageable deliverables.

## What you'll be building

We would like you to design a feature that visualizes team activity on the System Initiative workspace. Specifically, this feature should:

* Display areas of high collaboration and interaction in real time or over a specified period.
* Adapt dynamically as users zoom in or out, ensuring it scales seamlessly with varying numbers of collaborators.

### Key Considerations

* The design should integrate seamlessly with the current user experience and adhere to the design principles of System Initiative.
* Emphasize how the feature enhances collaboration and adds value to users.

## Deliverables

1. High-Fidelity Prototype, Wireframes or User Flow Diagrams
  Provide diagrams that clearly illustrate how a user would engage with the feature from start to finish.
  
2. Design Rationale
  Be prepared to discuss your design decisions during a follow-up session. Highlight:
    * The user value of the feature.
    * How it enhances collaboration.
    * How it integrates with System Initiative’s current design principles
  
## Guidelines

* Spend no more than 4 hours on this exercise. Focus on prioritizing and delivering key aspects of the feature.
* Your work should showcase:
    * Creativity and problem-solving.
    * An understanding of user needs and behaviors.
    * Attention to detail and usability.
    
## Submission

When you’ve finished, share the Figma link containing your high-fidelity prototype or wireframe along with the user flow diagrams. Ensure all materials are organized and labeled clearly for review.

If you'd like to keep the work private then you can share the link with `paul@systeminit.com` and `mahir@systeminit.com` as collaborators

We look forward to reviewing your work and discussing your thought process in the follow-up session!
